      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>TheDomainDesigners isn't your typical web design agency.
 We're a Houston, TX-born startup founded in 2024 by two passionate developers, Alex Metzger and Spencer Holan. Our story began way back in high school, where our shared love for coding ignited a spark that would eventually blossom into this collaborative venture. <br/><br/>
 <strong class="custom-bold">Alex Metzger</strong>, a graduate of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of North Texas. His thirst for knowledge and dedication to pushing boundaries fuels our innovative approach. <br/><br/>
 <strong class="custom-bold">Spencer Holan</strong>, a current computer science student, brings a wealth of real-world experience to the table. Since 2022, he's been honing his skills as a freelance web developer, tackling diverse projects and gaining valuable insights into client needs. <br/><br/>
 We believe that the future is built on collaboration and shared passion. That's why we prioritize open communication and a genuine understanding of your startup's vision. We're not just a web design company; we're your tech partners, eager to translate your ideas into a powerful digital reality.
